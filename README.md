# Medieval Manuscripts Preprocessing

The classification of historical documents usually includes three tasks as follows:
1) Font classification
2) Location classification
3) Date classification

In order to classify the fonts or the handwritings of manuscripts to know the author, image preprocessing would be necessary for better models training. Thus, this repository includes some preprocessing and text detection function. Futhermore, details about each process are given. The original manuscript used in this repository was posted by St. PÃ¶lten University on LinkedIn.
