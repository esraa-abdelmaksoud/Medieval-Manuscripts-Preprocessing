# Medieval Manuscripts Preprocessing

The classification of historical documents usually includes three tasks as follows:
1) Font classification
2) Location classification
3) Date classification

In order to classify the fonts or the handwritings of manuscripts to know the author, image preprocessing would be necessary for better models training. Thus, this repository includes some preprocessing and text detection function. Futhermore, details about each process are given. The original manuscript used in this repository was posted by St. PÃ¶lten University on LinkedIn.

## Cropping

Since the manuscript is a part of a book, slicing the image array or cropping the image is a better option than detecting edges. This is because the 4th edge of the book where the pages are connected might not be detected because of the light. Whenever the edge detection algorithm parameters are changed, more noise will be detected instead of that edge. Thus,cropping the image is a better choice because the book is not moved during scanning.

## Thresholding vs Quantization

Usually, to have clear handwrtings for model training, it is necessary to remove the background noise. This is to make the focus of the classification model the handwriting only regardless of the background. Thus, using thresholding (binarization) to remove the background can be a good option if no darkness or shadows exist in the image. However, if there are dark stains, they may affect the binarization if the thresholds are not chosen acurately.

Two-step color quantization can also be used. This is by detecting the text and applying it to each line seperately then to the whole page. This is because using two centoids in k-means algorithm while having some drawings may result in losing some text from the manuscript image. However, there might be some text if different colors in the same line that makes binarization preferred over quantization.

## Morphological Operations

In order to fill the gaps in handwritings, opening morphological operations are usually used. However, using it with calligraphy may affect the process of classifying handwritings. Thus, it is better to use a low kernel size to avoid affecting the calligraphy.

## PaddleOCR vs Tesseract Text Detection

Though Tesseract is one of the preferred open-source OCR packages that contains several page segmentation modes, it sometimes fails in detecting some text. It also uses OTSU binarization internally, so it misses text in colors that are close to the background color. It also may miss text in the detection process during segmentation issues. Furthermore, it may consider parts of drawings as text mistakenly.

In contrast, PaddleOCR works without binarizing images internally. It is superior in terms of text detection, and usually avoids problematic cropping if text overlaps in conscutive lines. In other words, some pixels of the manuscript image can be considered as a part of two lines and are not exclusively assigned to a single detected text line. This is to reduce the loss of text that should be as clean as possible to classify fonts.

The details above illustrate some analysis for how historical manuscript images can be initially pre-processed using OpenCV to improve future font classification results.
